      <p className="text-light-text leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I’m Arya Disastra, a passionate System Analyst, Fullstack Developer, and DevOps Engineer.
        Over the past 5 years, I’ve helped organizations like WHO, Kemenhan, and Smart City Kendari
        to design, build, and deploy scalable systems with modern architecture.
      </p>
      <p className="text-light-text leading-relaxed">
        I love working on end-to-end systems — from backend logic in Go or Laravel, to frontend design in Vue or React, 
        and deploying everything using Docker, CI/CD, and cloud infrastructure. 
      </p>
